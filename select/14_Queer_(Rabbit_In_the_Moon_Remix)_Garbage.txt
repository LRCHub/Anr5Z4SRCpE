Hey boy, take a look at me
Let me dirty up your mind
I'll strip away your hard veneer
And see what I can find

The queerest of the queer the strangest of the strange
The coldest of the cool the lamest of the lame
The numbest of the dumb I hate to see you here
You choke behind a smile a fake behind the fear
The queerest of the queer

This is what he pays me for
I'll show you how it's done
You learn to love the pain you feel
Like father like son

The queerest of the queer hide inside your head
The blindest of the blind the deadest of the dead
You're hungry cause you starve while holding back the tears
Choking on your smile a fake behind the fear
The queerest of the queer

I know what's good for you
(You can touch me if you want)
I know you're dying to
(You can touch me if you want)
I know what's good for you
(You can touch me if you want)
But you can't stop

The queerest of the queer the strangest of the strange
The coldest of the cool the lamest of the lame
The numbest of the dumb I hate to see you here
You choke behind a smile a fake behind the fear

The queerest of the queer the strangest of the strange
The coldest of the cool you're nothing special here
A fake behind the fear the queerest of the queer

I know what's good for you
I know you're dying to
I know what's good for you
I bet you're dying to

You can touch me if you want
You can touch me if you want
You can touch me you can touch me
You can't stop
